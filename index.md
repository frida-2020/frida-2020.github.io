The 7th Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms

September 3rd to September 5th 2020

Tentative schedule: 5pm to 7pm CET

The workshop is organized as part of QONFEST 2020, also hosting CONCUR 2020.

# Summary of the workshop

Distributed algorithms is an active research field; their applications range
from Internet applications over cloud computing to safety-critical control
systems. Whereas many applications are of critical importance, the correctness
of distributed algorithms is usually based on very subtle mathematical
arguments. Consequently, one easily can make mistakes with hand-written proofs,
which reduces the trust in the correctness of these systems.

In the last decades, formal methods were proven to be useful for the
verification of many hardware and software systems. For distributed algorithms,
the application of formal methods was limited: formal methods have been used
for finding bugs in distributed algorithms, and to a much smaller extent formal
methods were used in computer-aided veriﬁcation of simple distributed
algorithms. However, to verify more involved distributed algorithms, one cannot
easily apply existing verification tools. To be eventually able to do this, an
interdisciplinary effort from the concerned fields of formal methods, logic in
computer science, and distributed algorithm theory is required.

The topics of interest for the FRIDA workshop are:

* models for distributed algorithms
* model checking
* proof assistants & theorem proving
* parameterized model checking
* integration of different verification techniques
* concurrency
* distributed algorithm theory
* benchmark distributed algorithms
* fault tolerance
* synthesis
* automated code generation for distributed systems
* run-time verification of distributed systems

Starting a productive dialogue between distributed algorithms and verification
communities was the goal of a successful Dagstuhl Seminar “Formal Verification
of Distributed Algorithms”which was held in April 2013. During this seminar,
the participants agreed that a series of workshops should be held in order to
strengthen the community that does research on these issues. The 1st workshop
on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms took place in Vienna as part of
the Vienna Summer of Logic’14 and Federated Logic Conference’14. The 2ndFRIDA
workshop took place in Grenoble as part of FORTE’15. The 3rd FRIDA workshop was
organized in Marrakech as part of NETYS’16. The 4th FRIDA workshop took place
in Vienna as part of DISC 2017. The 5th FRIDA workshop was co-located with CAV
2018, which was held as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC).
